# Changelog

## Unreleased

* K16: duel loot no longer duplicates the Sword of Sharpness. A computer winner moves the right armour hit points,
  and its stat raise after a duel stops at 5 like a player's. `SAVEHOOK.COM` has a third handler (int 62h).
* GUIDE.md: a new player's guide covering the manual's topics in new text, the rules the manual leaves out, and
  the places where the manual and the game disagree.

## 0.4.0 – No ratmen disease, better music defaults

* K17: the ratmen disease is removed (it silently took a life point every four days).
* General MIDI: reverb and chorus settings recommended for GeneralUser GS; tested with GeneralUser GS 2.0.3.
* MT-32: tested with ROM version 1.07 (README gives the control ROM's SHA-1); volume lowered to 50%.
* Setup picks the best music available on a new install: MT-32 (ROMs), General MIDI (SoundFont) or AdLib.
* Setup no longer puts the AdLib tunes back when run again after GM or MT-32 was chosen.

## 0.3.0 – Game Over on Esc, player 2 on W A S D

* K5: Game Over moved from the Q key (next to the second player's W and A) to Esc.
* `Fixes_Off.bat` works again: original mode used the packed programs with `LOADFIX`, which left too little memory
  (*Insufficient memory*); it now uses the original programs only unpacked.
* README: a knight can carry at most 150 gold; the rest is lost without a warning.
* D9: player 2 moves with W, A, S, D (down was X).
* FIXES: K5, K10, K11 and D9 confirmed in play.

## 0.2.0 – Math and Mythral fix

* K11: Math the Wizard's stat gift and Mythral's messages read their tables wrongly (endurance never rose from
  Math, and his line could be a long list of garbage). Fixed.
* Docs: K4 is a safeguard, not the cure for the dragon fight hang reported on GOG.

## 0.1.0 – first public release

* Setup from the GOG DOS version (`Setup.bat`), checked by checksum; no game files included.
* Bug fixes K1, K2, K4, K10; intro and ending skip (K9).
* DOSBox-X with save states and automatic saves before every fight and every human turn (D6, D7).
* MT-32, General MIDI or AdLib music; optional Amiga intro and ending music from your own disk 1 (D8).
* Community DOSBox settings (speed, joystick, output), 4:3 picture, mouse off.
* Released under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
